# Oaks-more-blips
a lightweight simple ScriptHookVDotNet script to add more blips to the map for easily navigating around the map, due to most locations in the game being unknown, this simple script aims to bring more blips to the map to enjoy.
Focusing on lore and RP, this script is perfect for those who play LSPDFR or just want to add some more realism to your game.
